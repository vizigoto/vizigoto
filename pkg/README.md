`pkg` is a collection of utility packages used by the this project without being specific to its internals.

Utility packages are kept separate from the core codebase to keep it as small and concise as possible.
If some utilities grow larger and their APIs stabilize, they may be moved to their own package or
repository under the organization, to facilitate re-use. However that is not the priority.
